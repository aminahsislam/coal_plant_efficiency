# coal_plant_efficiency

A coal combustion pilot plant is used to obtain efficiency data on the collection of particulate matter by an electrostatics precipitator (ESP). The ESP performance is varied by changing the surface area of the collecting plates and the collected data is shown in Figure 1. 

The assumed model takes the form shown in Figure 2, and a python code was written to estimate the coefficients of the model, and then plot the experimental data vs. modeled data


A python code results are displayed in figure1.  Figure E2.2 shows the data col-lected to estimate the coefficients in a model to represent efficiency 7 as a function ofthe specific collection area A, measured as plate arealvolumetric flow rate.

The CSV file for the experimental data was extracted from Figure 1 via the WebPlotDigitizer website https://apps.automeris.io/wpd/

The informatiom for this project was taken from the book, "Optimization of chemical processes, second edition. By Thomas F. Edgar, David M. Himmelblau, and Leon S. Lasdon, McGraw Hill, New York."
